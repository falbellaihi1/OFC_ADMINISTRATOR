## OFC AUTOMATED ADMINISTRATION

PROJECT CREATED AS A DIRTY WORKAROUND TO MANAGE BATTLEFIELD V COMMUNITY SERVER, THANKS TO DICE WHO PROVIDED GREAT TOOLS THAT HAD US TO CREATE THIS TOOL


## PROJECT IDEA
Image processing, to convert text in image and based on it enforce server rules. 

1- The tool checks the kill log and converts the weapons into text and checks the list if player is using banned weapon 
  - Should automatically click ESC and finds the player in scoreboard and click kick
      * Challenge here is the movement of players score which changes their place which makes it harder to kick accurately 
      
  - Should check the scoreboard to check for all joined players and check if one of them is in the banlist created by OFC members
2- Sends a welcome message along with rules. (Working but needs inhancemments | note this is just a dirty work around)

3- The vote ban is implemented but not done as some of the community did not like the idea, but will leave it open for future as it is 30% implemented. 



# The code! 

NO I havent followed the best practice as I also have taken large chuncks of code from somewhere but dont remeber from where. 

I didnt have a time while I am working on this project and wanted to save time managing a server and save the community time for short (Automate the boring task)
